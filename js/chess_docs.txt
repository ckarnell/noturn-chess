Chess(fen)
    Basically the entire class. Has DEFAUL_POSITION set to the default fen, pawn 
    offsets and piece offsets, ATTACKS, RAYS, SHIFTS, BITS, SQUARES and FLAGS.
    This class contains all the following methods.

clear()
    Resets values to be empty, and then runs update_setup(generate_fen());

reset()
    Just says "load(DEFAULT_POSITION);"

load(fen)
    Returns false if not a valid fen (uses !validate_fen(fen).valid).

move(move)
    Uses generate_moves() and compares the move against that the values
    in there. If there are none, returns null. Otherwise, uses
    make_move(move_obj) to make the move, and returns a readable version
    of the move.

    There *must* be a bug in generate_moves() that can't find the right move
    when the black d pawn is moved up twice in a row, since that move should be
    legal. Make move must also be messing up, since that's where the fen
    is being altered.

generate_moves(options)
    make_move is called in this function.
